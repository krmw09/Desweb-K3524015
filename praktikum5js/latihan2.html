  <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
  <p id="paragraf1">
    The <span>Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</span>, <span>Sebelas Maret University</span>, Surakarta
    is an <span>Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study
    programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing
    <span>superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</span>.
  </p>
  <p id="paragraf2">
    The <span>Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is
    planned to take shelter in the management of the <span>Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department.
    This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under
    the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <span>prioritized
    to teach in vocational programs</span>. So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department
    which oversees vocational programs such as <span>Building Engineering Education</span>, and
    <span>Mechanical Engineering Education</span>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of
    information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will
    conduct <span>resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
